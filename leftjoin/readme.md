# Left Join
Code Challenge: Class 33

### Challenge
Implement a left join for 2 hash tables


### Approach & Efficiency


My function:

takes in two objects which serve as the hash tables
returns a matrix with inner arrays representing the keys, values from the left object matched with that key, and values from the right object matched with that key
