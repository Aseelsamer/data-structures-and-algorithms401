# ll-kth-from-end

## Challenge
Where k is greater than the length of the linked list
Where k and the length of the list are the same
Where k is not a positive integer
Where the linked list is of a size 1
“Happy Path” where k is not at the end, but somewhere in the middle of the linked list

## Approach & Efficiency
Used classes and while loop.

## API
 numFromtheEnd takes one parameter which the number you will test in the LL .
