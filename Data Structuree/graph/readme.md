# Graphs

A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices (also called nodes or points), together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.


## Challenge
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:
-AddNote()

-AddEdge()

-GetNeighbors()

-Size()

## API 
Big O 
Time ->O(1)
Space -> O(n)
